✅ 1. Total Spent and Average Not Updating
❌ Problem:

In your Transaction History UI, you're not calling /api/transactions/stats, so you're not getting:

Total transactions

Completed

Total spent

Average amount

✅ Fix:

In your frontend (e.g., pages/TransactionHistory.jsx or wherever you're rendering that transaction summary), I will:

Add a useEffect() to call /api/transactions/stats

Update the state with totalRevenue, averageAmount, etc.

Update the UI with these values.

➕ You also already have the backend route /api/transactions/stats that returns correct values — so this fix is only frontend.
✅ 2. Pass Type in Receipt is N/A
❌ Problem:

Pass type is not always saved in the pass document — or not returned in /history/passes.

✅ Fix:

✅ You're already saving passType in /buy-pass route in payment.js → confirmed.

✅ Backend route /history/passes returns the entire pass object.

❌ In renderPassCard(), you're using:

pass.passType || "N/A"


If passType is not in older passes (pre-fix), it shows as "N/A".

✅ Solution:

Ensure all newly created passes include passType (✅ done).

For existing "N/A" values: optionally provide a fallback (e.g., derive from mode+duration if needed).

✅ 3. "One Day" Passes Should Auto-Set validTill = validFrom
❌ Problem:

You have this logic in /buy-pass:

if (!amount || !mode || !validFrom || !validTill || !passType) return res.status(400)...


But if user selects "One Day", frontend must send same validFrom and validTill.

✅ Fix:

In the frontend BuyPass component, add:

if (passType === "One Day") {
  setValidTill(validFrom); // or ensure it's the same before sending
}

✅ 4. Dropdown: Prevent Same Location Selection
❌ Problem:

Currently, both start and end locations can be the same.

✅ Fix:

In the frontend:

When user selects a startLocation, filter the endLocation options to exclude the selected startLocation and vice versa.

✅ 5. Missing Location Dropdown for Transports
❌ Problem:

You removed dropdowns for selecting locations per transport mode (Bus, Train, Metro, All-in-One).

✅ Fix:

I’ll:

Reintroduce transport-specific dropdowns

Show location options based on selected mode

Enable typing to search using a searchable <select> (e.g., with react-select or custom searchable dropdown).

✅ 6. Add More Locations

Your backend has these for pricing:

const allLocations = {
  Bus: ["T Nagar", "Guindy", "Tambaram", "Velachery"],
  Train: ["Chennai Central", "Egmore", "Tambaram", "Mambalam"],
  Metro: ["Airport", "Ashok Nagar", "Guindy", "Washermanpet"]
};

✅ Fix:

I’ll extract this into a shared config (locationConfig.js)

Add 5–10 more locations for each mode

Use this both for pricing and dropdown rendering

✅ 7. Implement Home Page for All Roles
❌ Problem:

You're not rendering custom dashboards based on role (Admin, TransportManager, Passenger)

✅ Fix:

Create a single Home.jsx

Based on user.role, render:

✅ AdminDashboard

✅ ManagerDashboard

✅ PassengerDashboard
